# Fraud-Detection---3-Unsupervised-Supervised-Deep-Learning-
Fraud detection utilizing advanced methods from Unsupervised/Supervised and Deep Learning
This dataset has 538,000 rows of data and 31 data points.

In this project will employ the Semi-Supervised Learning using the following techniques:

*  Stacking, boosting and bagging for creation of Meta-Classifiers
*  DNN and Keras metrics for imbalanced data
*  Random forest
*  Anomaly detection w/ LOF & Isolation Forest models
*  SVC
*  KNN clusters
*  Ridge Regression
*  Extra Trees
*  TSNE w/ KNN
*  Undersampling
